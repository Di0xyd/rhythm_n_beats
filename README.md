# Projet IOT - Rythmn_hits

The goal of this project is to allow a drummer to train his rythmic accuracy.
It is composed of a metronome, a beat checker and a web interface to check for the accuracy and set the BPM.

## Needed hardware
- Weemos D1 Mini
- RGB LED with common anode
- Passive Buzzer
- SW-420 Vibration sensor

## Installation notes

The wifi code is based of this github repository so, you will need to follow their instructions:
- https://github.com/honnet/iot_intro/wiki/IOT-Intro

You will also need to add the bounce2 library which is used to debounce inputs :
- https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2

- Once these steps are completed, you will need to push the code into the Arduino, setup the wifi via the captive portal, then check on the Arduino console for the IP address of the server on your local network. Connect, et voil√† !

## Steps followed
We made the project by following these steps :

- Creating the metronome :
  - Code and hardware :
    - Light on each beat (On a fixed 60BPM beat)
    - Sound on each beat
    - Light on the first beat of a measure
      - IHM
        - get Current BPM
        - set new BPM

- Creating the beat checker
  - Code and hardware :
    - check for beats with vibration sensor
    - check if beats are good or bad
    - blink red led if bad
  - IHM :
    - show number of good beats
    - show number of wrong beats
    - Graphs of beats for last measures
